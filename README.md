# Firefighter Robot Code

> Maze-solving firefighter robot, built from scratch and capable of <5 second solves.

In our grade twelve Computer Engineering class, we were tasked with building a firefighter robot. The robot's capabilities were to navigate a maze, avoiding obstacles in it such as pits, and to ultimately locate a candle-lit flame and extinguish it. The bot was controlled using a PIC16F18875 microcontroller, which was programmed with Great Cow Basic as the language, and MELab's mePROG software to program the chip.

Available in this repository are the base programs for the microcontroller, in the .gcb format. Also available are compiled versions of the file, in both raw hex and assembly, and the project proposal that contains the general outline of this project and information on the robot's numerous subsystems.

[Attached](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__ndANnyCtA) is a run of our robot, in which it set a new record for one of two mazes.
